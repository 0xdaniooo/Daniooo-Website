# Daniooo Website
My personal website built with HTML, SCSS, TypeScript and Bootstrap 5 where I host all my content in one convenient place.

## About
Back in September 2022, I had created a website under this same URL where I displayed nearly the same content as seen here. This was made in anticipation of my placement search, allowing potential employers to see my work in a visual format. My skillset was very lacking at that time as this had only been the second website I had developed and thus aesthetically the layout looked very cheap and outdated; functionality wise, everything was very restrictive as all content was housed on a singular page which meant I could not include all my pieces of content. Wanting to test my new and improved skillset, I decided to rework the website and incorporate all the details and elements I had not been able to implement previously.


## Features
- Responsive layout which works across various screen sizes (desktop, mobile etc)
- Animations and other little details to make the website feel alive
- Content is added to the DOM and rendered onto the screen dynamically through JavaScript
- Display content based on collections
- Ability to change content sorting
